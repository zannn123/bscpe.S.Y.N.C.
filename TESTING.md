## 🔍 API Testing (Advanced)

Use curl or Postman to test API endpoints:

### Registration
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fullName":"Test User","idNumber":"TEST-123","password":"password123"}'
```

### Student Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login/student \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"idNumber":"TEST-123","password":"password123"}'
```

### Admin Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login/admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"adminCode":"CPE-SYNC-ADMIN-2025"}'
```

### Create Event
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Event","description":"API Test","dateTime":"2025-07-25T14:00:00","attendanceCode":"API123"}'
```

### Get Events
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/events
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Server Won't Start
- Check if port 3000 is available
- Verify Node.js and npm are installed
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies

### Real-time Updates Not Working
- Check browser console for Socket.IO errors
- Verify network connection
- Try refreshing the page

### File Uploads Failing
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Ensure file is an image (JPG/PNG)
- Verify uploads directory exists

### Database Issues
- Application uses in-memory storage
- Data resets when server restarts
- For production, implement persistent database

## 📊 Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- Test with multiple concurrent users
- Verify Socket.IO handles multiple connections
- Monitor memory usage during heavy load

### Image Processing
- Test with various image sizes
- Verify upload speed with large files
- Check image display performance

## ✅ Expected Test Results

All tests should pass with:
- ✅ Successful authentication for both roles
- ✅ Real-time updates working across devices
- ✅ Responsive design on all screen sizes
- ✅ Secure file uploads and validation
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
